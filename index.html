Her age range and me is between 19 years. This is because she is from another mother, stepmother. My birth mother has passed away when I am 15 years old. She had cancer pancreas. I believe that everything happens to us there are reason behind it.</figcaption></center>

   <figcaption>&#9827; Afternoon came.. How about start baking so that the time were well used! The first picture from the left is Apam Susu! I, at first just want to try to use the simple recipes from google to do some baked. Then I found that the recipes of this Apam Susu and the instruction is easy for me to follow. Also, the ingredients of that apam are all available in my home.</figcaption>
    <figcaption>&#9827; Next, the picture on the center is donut. This was the request from my stepmother. So I just try to find the recipes in Mr.Google with hope that the donut will become soft and fluffy. I am a bit sad. The result that I got was not that fluffy. Nevermind.. This was first try..</figcaption>
    <figcaption>&#9827; Lastly, the last picture on the right is chocolate cake made by my stepmother with the assistant of me! Hahahahaa... This special cake is for my dad's birthday cake. The result is...... very yummyyyyy then the bakery made! My dad also like it very much. We are very happy to hear that. Besides can save family's budget, this also can strengthen the family's relationship. </figcaption>
